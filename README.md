# Change Log #
## 03/13/20: Chapter 7 Update ##
Code is now working with the latest RC. While going through the code and validating I'm finding places that need improvement (beyond just the RC update). 
Do not hesitate to reach out if you have improvements that make sense to you. 
It used to be that `ErrorMiddleware` would return errors automatically and nicely formatted. That is something we need to do ourselves now, I left the code very generic for now but I'm working on coming up with something better.

## 03/08/20: Chapter 5 + 6 Update ##
The template has been updated to work with the most recent version of Vapor and Fluent.
